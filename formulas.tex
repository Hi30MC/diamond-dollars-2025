We first begin by taking the mean and standard deviation across all statstics (TB, ERA, etc.) in a given season:

$$\mu = \frac{\sum x_n}{n}$$
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_n-\mu)^2}{(n-1)}}$$

From there, we calculate our test statistic and p-value:

$$t = \frac{\mu_{samp} - \mu_{pop}}{\sigma}$$

$p = P(t*_{df}\geq t)$

where we assume our data to be normally distributed with $df$ degrees of freedom.

We then continue by transforming this p-value to prioritize extreme scores (low p-value) and normalize to be from $0$ to $\infty$

$p_{trans} = \frac 1p - 1 = \frac{1-p}{p}$

In our data sheets, we refer to this value as the s-statistic or the r-statistic for save and relief models respectively. Finally, we sum over all statistics, arriving at our combined statistic:

$\boxed{\text{Save}/\text{Relief} = \sum p_{trans}}$
